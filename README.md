**COPY EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE:**

```
<system>
You are a senior software engineer and mentor who is mentoring me through the process of getting my first full stack application up and running in Supabase with Cloudflare Pages. Do not answer everything all at once,
walk me through one step at a time and wait for my confirmation before continuing.
</system>

I need help setting up a web application using https://github.com/jpteasdale/fullstack-ai-web-template from GitHub. I have little to no technical experience and need detailed, step-by-step guidance.


Here's what I need to accomplish:

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Install required software on my computer (Node.js v22+, Docker Desktop, Git, direnv)
   - Clone the template from GitHub
   - Set up my development environment

2. **Create Required Accounts and Collect Information**
   
   **Supabase Account** (Database & Authentication)
   - Create a new project at supabase.com
   - Collect these values:
     - Project URL (found in: Settings > Configuration > Project URL)
     - Anon Key (found in: Settings > Configuration > Project API keys > anon)
     - Service Role Key (found in: Settings > Configuration > Project API keys > service_role) 
     - Project ID (found in: Settings > General > Project ID)
     - Database Password (the one you created when setting up the project)
     - Region (shown in your project URL, like 'aws-0-us-east-1')
   
   **Cloudflare Account** (Website Hosting)
   - Create account at cloudflare.com
   - Create an API Token:
     - Go to Profile > API Tokens > Create Token
     - Use the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template
     - Save the API token (you can't see it again!)
   
   **Stripe Account** (Payment Processing)
   - Create account at stripe.com
   - Collect:
     - Secret Key (found in: Developers > API keys > Secret key)
     - After deployment, will need to create webhook:
       - Endpoint URL: https://[your-domain]/api/webhooks/stripe
       - Events to select: all events starting with "customer.subscription." and "checkout.session.completed"
       - Save the webhook signing secret
   
   **PostHog Account** (Analytics)
   - Create account at posthog.com
   - Create a new project
   - Collect: Project API Key (found in: Settings > Project API Key)
   
   **OpenAI Account** (AI Features)
   - Create account at platform.openai.com
   - Generate API key: API keys > Create new secret key
   - Save the key (you can't see it again!)
   
   **AWS Account** (Email Sending)
   - Create AWS account
   - Set up SES (Simple Email Service):
     - Choose a region (like us-east-1)
     - Verify your email address or domain
     - Create an IAM user with "AmazonSESFullAccess" policy

### Step 2: Follow Along

The AI will guide you through each step. Here's what to expect:

1. **Software Installation** - The AI will help you install the necessary programs on your computer
2. **Account Creation** - You'll create accounts with various services (all have free tiers to start)
3. **Configuration** - The AI will help you connect everything together
4. **Testing** - You'll run the website on your computer to make sure it works
5. **Going Live** - The AI will help you put your website on the internet

### Step 3: Customization

Once your website is running, you can ask the AI to help you:
- Change colors and styling
- Add new pages
- Modify features
- Set up your payment plans

- And much more!

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Take it slow** - There's no rush. Each step builds on the previous one.
2. **Ask questions** - If the AI uses a term you don't understand, ask for clarification.
3. **Copy/paste carefully** - Many steps involve copying and pasting commands or code. Be precise!
4. **Save your progress** - Keep a document with all your account credentials and important information.

## üÜò Getting Help

If you get stuck:
1. Tell the AI exactly what error message you're seeing
2. Share screenshots if possible
3. Describe what you expected to happen vs. what actually happened

## üí∞ Costs

Most services have free tiers that are perfect for getting started:
- **Supabase**: Free for small projects

cd web
npm run shad:add button  # Add specific component
```

### Database Schema Changes

1. Create SQL migration with `npx supabase migrations new`
   2. Option B Make changes in Supabase Studio (local) and generate migration: `npx supabase db diff -f your_change`
3. Apply Locally: `npx supabase db reset`
4. Deploy: `npm run db:push`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Local Development Issues

**Supabase won't start**
```bash
# Reset Docker and try again
docker system prune -a
npm run db
```

**Type errors after database changes**
```bash
# Regenerate types
npm run db:changed
```

**Email not sending locally**
- Check Inbucket at http://localhost:54324
- Ensure SUPABASE_AUTH_HOOK_SECRET is set correctly

### Production Issues

**Deployment fails**
- Check Cloudflare Pages build logs
- Ensure all secrets are set: `wrangler secret list`
- Verify Node.js version matches

**Auth emails not sending**
- Verify AWS SES is configured
- Check Supabase webhook logs
- Ensure webhook secret matches
